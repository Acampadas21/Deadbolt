LocketteSimpleClansBridge v1.0
The purpose of this plugin is to bridge functionality between Lockette and SimpleClans
By using [ClanName] on signs, the bridge will query SimpleClans to check if a player is a member of it.
If your clan's name is greater than 13 characters, for example MyClanNameIsReallyBig truncate it for the sign as [MyClanNameIsR]. 
WARNING: "MyClanNameIsReallyBig" and "MyClanNameIsReallyHuge" would both have authorization to use the same block due to the truncation.
