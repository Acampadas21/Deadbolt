LocketteTownyBridge v1.0
The purpose of this plugin is to bridge functionality between Lockette and Towny
By using [TownName] or [NationName] on signs, the bridge will query Towny to check if a player is a member of either.
If your town's name is greater than 13 characters, for example MyTownNameIsReallyBig truncate it for the sign as [MyTownNameIsR]. 
WARNING: "MyTownNameIsReallyBig" and "MyTownNameIsReallyHuge" would both have authorization to use the same block due to the truncation.
