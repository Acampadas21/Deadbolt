DeadboltBridge Towny
The purpose of this plugin is to bridge functionality between Deadbolt and Towny
[TownName] [NationName] All town members
+TownName+ +NationName+ Mayors and Assistants ONLY
Any of the above go on a Deadbolt sign in the place you would normally put another person's name.
If your town's name is greater than 13 characters, for example MyTownNameIsReallyBig truncate it for the sign as [MyTownNameIsR]. 
WARNING: "MyTownNameIsReallyBig" and "MyTownNameIsReallyHuge" would both have authorization to use the same block due to the truncation.
